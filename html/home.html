			     Welcome to TYPK! My name is Sudheer Suri, am a Full Stack developer based in Canada. Am the founder of TYPK. The sole purpose of creating this website is to provide a platform to test your programming knowledge by testing you on tricky concepts that i personally handpicked. If you scroll down a bit, you will see all the test sets i have created, they are mostly multiple choice questions that you cannot answer unless you have the grip on the concepts.
